# Horiseon Code Refactoring

## Description

My motivation was to build and test my HTML and CSS knowledge
I built this project using code provided by the full stack course to enhance my understanding of the HTML and CSS topics reviewed last week.
This does not solve a problem but does provide vital experience for me to learn
I learned how to refactor code. The tasks involved with refactoing included but are not limitet too; semantc HTML, logical tag structure, correct global, section, class and ID styling.
